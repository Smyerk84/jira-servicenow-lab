# IT Service Management & Agile Workflow Lab (ServiceNow + Jira)

**Hands-on lab demonstrating IT ticket lifecycle management with ServiceNow (incident management) and Jira (Agile project tracking).**

---

## 📌 Overview

This lab demonstrates my ability to work with two of the most widely used IT ticketing systems: **ServiceNow** and **Jira**.  

I simulated a real-world IT support workflow where incidents created in ServiceNow were escalated to development teams using Jira for Agile sprint tracking.  

This project shows practical proficiency in **incident management**, **service request handling**, and **Agile project tracking**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Create and manage incidents in **ServiceNow**  
- Create and track Agile issues, epics, and sprints in **Jira**  
- Simulate escalation from IT Support (**ServiceNow**) to Development (**Jira**)  
- Follow **ITIL Incident Management** and **Agile Scrum** workflows  
- Document the full lifecycle from creation → escalation → resolution → closure

## 🛠️ Tools & Setup

- [ServiceNow Developer Instance](https://developer.servicenow.com/) (free personal instance)  
- [Jira Cloud Free](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/free) (Scrum project template)

## 📂 Scenario

I acted as the **IT Support Engineer** for a healthcare company:

1. A **ServiceNow incident** was created for a system outage:  

   > “Multiple users cannot log in to the EMR system. Authentication suspected.”  
   > Ticket assigned and triaged.

2. The issue required development escalation, so a **Problem record** was created and referenced in **Jira**.  

3. In **Jira**, I created:  
   - An **Epic**: “Authentication System Fixes”  
   - A **Story**: “Investigate and resolve EMR login issue”  
   - Added the Story to a **Sprint** and tracked it from *To Do → In Progress → Done*.  

4. Once resolved in Jira, I updated ServiceNow and closed the original incident.

**Flow Description:**

1. **User Reports Issue** → ServiceNow Incident Created  
2. **Incident Triaged** → Problem Escalated to Jira  
3. **Jira Epic & Story Created** → Added to Sprint  
4. **Development Team Resolves Issue** → Updates Jira Story Status  
5. **Incident Closed in ServiceNow** → Workflow Complete
