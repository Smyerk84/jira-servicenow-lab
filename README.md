# jira-servicenow-lab
Hands-on lab demonstrating IT ticket lifecycle management with ServiceNow (incident management) and Jira (Agile project tracking).
# IT Service Management & Agile Workflow Lab (ServiceNow + Jira)

## 📌 Overview
This lab demonstrates my ability to work with two of the most widely used IT ticketing systems: **ServiceNow** and **Jira**.  
I simulated a real-world IT support workflow where incidents created in ServiceNow were escalated to development teams using Jira for Agile sprint tracking.  
This project shows practical proficiency in **incident management**, **service request handling**, and **Agile project tracking**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Create and manage incidents in **ServiceNow**  
- Create and track Agile issues, epics, and sprints in **Jira**  
- Simulate escalation from IT Support (ServiceNow) to Development (Jira)  
- Follow **ITIL Incident Management** and **Agile Scrum** workflows  
- Document the full lifecycle from creation → escalation → resolution → closure

## 🛠️ Tools & Setup
- [ServiceNow Developer Instance](https://developer.servicenow.com/) (free personal instance)  
- [Jira Cloud Free](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/free) (Scrum project template)

## 📂 Scenario
I acted as the **IT Support Engineer** for a healthcare company:  

1. A ServiceNow **incident** was created for a system outage:  
   - *“Multiple users cannot log in to the EMR system. Authentication suspected.”*  
   - Ticket assigned and triaged.  

2. The issue required development escalation, so a **Problem record** was created and referenced in **Jira**.  

3. In Jira, I created:  
   - An **Epic**: “Authentication System Fixes”  
   - A **Story**: “Investigate and resolve EMR login issue”  
   - Added the Story to a **Sprint** and tracked it from *To Do → In Progress → Done*.  

4. Once resolved in Jira, I updated ServiceNow and closed the original incident.
